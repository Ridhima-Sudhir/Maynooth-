A personal project I worked on in 2020 to master the use of Adobe XD <br>
Problem statement: <br>Designing a website and app selling furniture, while keeping in mind the industry standards and using material.io guidelines <br>
Wireframes: <br> Using Adobe XD, I drew up low-fidelity wireframes based on the current websites in the market. Then, I improved them by adding a few relevant stock images. I then made changes to increase the aesthetics and user flow. <br>
UI Design: <br>After making changes to my wireframes, I moved on to design the final screens in Adobe XD. My goal was to create something elegant yet luxurious while following the Material.io guidelines. <br>
This really helped me understand and learn to use the various features of Adobe XD and helped me master the different features of the platform.
